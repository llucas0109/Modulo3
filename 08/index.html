            <p>I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
                Yeah
                To take a stand (to take a stand)
                It's been a ride
                Everybody (everybody)
                I guess I had to go to that place
                Come take my hand (come take my hand)
                To get to this one
                We'll walk this road together, through the storm</p>

                    <p>Now some of you might still be in that place
                        Whatever weather, cold or warm
                        If you're tryna get out (just lettin' you know that you're not alone)
                        Just follow me (holla if you feel like you've been down the same road)
                        I'll get you thereNow some of you might still be in that place </p>

            <p>You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
                But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
                'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
                When I say I'm a do somethin', I do it
                I don't give a damn what you think</p>

                    <p>And I just can't keep living this way
                        So starting today
                        I'm breaking out of this cage
                        I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons
                        I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground
                        I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
                        Time to put my life back together right now (now)</p>
